#--Write 1-2 paragraphs about your StrengthsFinder themes: How have you seen yourself using these strengths at Turing? Has your understanding of these strengths changed since you first reflected on them? If so, how?

##My time here at Turing has helped give me a much deeper understanding of my StrengthFinder themes. Initially I could relate to the findings but now as I read them particular features really jump out that I can see I'm definded by. My Strategic approach helps reinforce my Maximizer strength in which I "discover each person’s special talents, skills, knowledge, mission, likes, and dislikes. This information helps you personalize your words and deeds." A better understanding of a individual brings me to my Relator strength as I like to identify with people who share their ambitions, hopes, or intentions with you. It seems my Ideation strengths "favor conversations where information, facts, or data are considered objectively — that is, emotions do not distort the truth;" play to my Achiver strengths because I "resist devoting time to activities that impede progress, compromise productivity, or waste precious time."

##I have come to realize some of the downsides of my strengths: My Ideation can boost my Achiver, while it is important/crutial to take some "fun" time. As a Maximizer boosting my Realtor at times I jsut need to socalize or put myself out there more.

#--Write a story about your Turing experience so far: When have you struggled? How have you dealt with struggle? When have you succeeded at Turing? How did you accomplish those successes?

##Realizing my need to dig into a problem and work it out, find that solution; I would get lost in time / falling dowm those rabbit holes. I have learned to break up the time, dig for solution then ask for help. Additionally it was helpful to break up the time and focus; have a set time of day to simply pratice typing. Setting timers and keeping poms has been very helpful.

#--After you practice storytelling in the session, answer this question: What was particularly easy or difficult about telling your story? What are 1-2 steps that you can take to continue to improve your abilities to tell your story, talk about yourself with ease, and examine your strengths?

##Initally during my start at Turing it was very uncomfortable to "look" at myself. Now I can better realize how I respond to situations and people. I think pratice and reafaulating my strengths will be great tools.
